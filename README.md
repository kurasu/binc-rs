# binc-rs
Rust implementtion of the [binc file format](https://github.com/kurasu/binc).

This is a work in progress.

Apart from a library itself, it includes a simple command-line tool which can also acts as a toy server, which is used to try out netweork collaboration concepts. 

There are also couple of gui apps (using egui) to try out things including binc explorer which is supposed to become some generic viewer editor thing.
